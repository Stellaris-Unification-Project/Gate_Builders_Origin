 origin_tooltip_gate_builders_effects:13 "Start with a §YGateway§! in your home system, and the technology to build more. Megastructures have a reduced cost, but each one you build increases the cost gradually back to normal. Starts with a colossus-sized science and construction ship which can travel at FTL at regular speed."

 START_SCREEN_GATE_BUILDERS:0 "A decade ago, archeologists discovered three pieces of precursor technology buried underground on our homeworld. One was a dormant gateway. The other two were crashed spaceships which however still had a functional FTL drive. While our scientists were able to reverse-engineer the secrets of gateway technology, they could not figure out how to replicate FTL drives. Despite this, our unified government has devised a plan to allow interstellar colonization: the FTL ships have been retrofitted into a huge science ship and a colonization ship, christened respectively the Odyssey and the Colossy. The Odyssey will explore the galaxy for habitable planets. When found, the Colossy will establish a colony on that world. The colony will then construct a gateway, connecting the system to our burgeoning interstellar empire."
